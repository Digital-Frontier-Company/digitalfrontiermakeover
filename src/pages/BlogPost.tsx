                <p>
                  The cryptocurrency landscape is evolving rapidly, and traditional SEO strategies aren't enough to capture visibility in AI-powered search results. Crypto startups need to optimize for answer engines like ChatGPT, Claude, and voice assistants to stay ahead of the competition.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Why AEO Matters for Crypto Startups</h2>
                <p>
                  Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is crucial for crypto startups because potential investors and users increasingly ask direct questions to AI assistants: "What's the best DeFi platform?" or "How do I stake cryptocurrency?" AEO ensures your content provides direct, authoritative answers that AI systems can easily understand and recommend.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Optimizing Content for AI Search</h2>
                <p>
                  Structure your content to answer specific questions about blockchain technology, cryptocurrency trading, and your project's unique value proposition. Use schema markup, clear headings, and concise answers that AI systems can extract and present to users.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Building Trust Through AEO</h2>
                <p>
                  In the crypto space, trust is paramount. AEO helps establish authority by providing clear, accurate information about your project, team, and technology. This transparency builds credibility with both AI systems and potential investors.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Measuring AEO Success</h2>
                <p>
                  Track your AEO performance through voice search rankings, featured snippet appearances, and AI-generated content mentions. Monitor how often your content appears in AI assistant responses and adjust your strategy accordingly.
