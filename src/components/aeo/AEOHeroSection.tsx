      <p className="text-slate-300 text-lg mb-6">
        Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is a modern strategy that refines your content to deliver direct 
        answers to user queries. Unlike traditional SEO, which casts a wide net to rank pages for broad keywords, 
        AEO zeroes in on providing quick, concise responsesâ€”think Google's featured snippets, voice search results, 
        or AI-driven answer boxes.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-300 text-lg">
        The goal is simple: position your content as the immediate solution, not just a link to it. 
        This boosts visibility and caters to the growing preference for fast answers in today's 
        digital landscape, shaped by evolving technology and a demand for instant, digestible information.
